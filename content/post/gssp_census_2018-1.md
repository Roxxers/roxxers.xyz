# <a name="Intro">Introduction</a>

Hey GSSP, before we get into the publishing of the results I have to say sorry for the time it has taken to publish the census data. I have been busy and keeping up with other projects (Roxbot!) 

That doesn't mean it has gone to waste, we have already used a decent chunk of the data to improve GSSP. 

- We have used the feedback to improve the mod team accountability and efficiency. We now have a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to help our mods as a guideline and to hold them accountable as a 'mod rulebook' of sorts. We also have taken the other feedback about the mod team and applied it to the SOP above while also addressing it immediately.

- We have taken strides to make sure the marginalised in our server (mostly trans men and straight people) are treated better, and have dealt with the issues related to these populations on our server. We aren’t 100% there yet, but we are dedicated to solving the issues as they arise.

- We have introduced Movie Night after a good reception to it in the census and have planned to make Game Night a thing in future. 

- We used responses about a potential future bot (that was received well) to know that we should keep going with those plans. That bot also included a ban appeals system that has already been implemented by the mod team and is effectively in beta. 

I hope you have noticed these improvements in the last 3 months (yes it has been that long!) and that we have done a good job of self-improvement. 

We won't be publishing all the data due to the time its taken to do this. Most of the data in sections two and three (used in the above points) are kinda irrelevant now due to the improvements above and our growing Staff. 

Only section one of the census will be published, excluding one question. Explainations of how that data has helped us is with the data itself. This data only reflects the demographics of GSSP users. I feel that is is pretty interesting and is also good to keep in mind as a user. 

Note: All raw data tables can be found at the bottom page, labelled as "Raw Results"

# <a name="Results">The Results</a>

The GSSP March 2018 Census got 326 responses. That's around a 17% turnout if we take the current population of the server. Around 300~ users is what I calculated to be 'active' last month  (May). So all in all this was a pretty high turn out considering the participation rate of large online spaces. 

## <a name="C&C">Countries and Continents</a>

One thing we knew going into the census is that 🇺🇲'Murica (Fuck yeah!)🇺🇲 would top the demographics of nationalities, so the results here aren't surprising. It is interesting none the less to see where our users come from.

### <a name="Countries">Countries</a>

Question: *"Which country are you currently residing in?"*

In the census, we asked "Which country are you currently residing in?" to gauge what the geography of the server looked like. While that typically doesn't matter with our Discord Server, it is handy to know for a few reasons as it can help you plan events and know what is the most common background of our users. Also, it can make pretty graphs as seen below.

{{< figure src="../../img/census18-1/countriesbargraph.png" title="Countries Bar Graph" alt="Countries Bar Graph" >}}

America wins by far with 189 respondents (58%), with the UK coming second at 40 (12%). Trailing the top 5 are Canada (28 - 9%), Australia (19 - 6%), and Germany & Netherlands (7 - 2%). The most surprising response, for me, is the one user who is residing in the Faroe Islands. Hi! 🇫🇴 

{{< figure src="../../img/census18-1/worldgraph.png" title="World map mapped to GSSP country data" alt="World map mapped to GSSP country data" >}}

Here is a pretty world map with every country that has at least one user lit up in red. The more users from that country, the darker the red. The scaling could be better but America dominates the range so it's a lil harder to see the differences between Australia and Germany, for instance.

We have used the data since to try and coordinate things like Movie Night and potential Game Nights and also to have a better idea when we should be expecting spikes in traffic. The most notable usage of this date was the Regions roles, which mapped the data here to make some roles people could self-assign. We also used the data to help shortlist the mods for the second mod election. While that ended up not mattering too much, it was part of the thinking process.

One thing that could have been improved in the question is providing all countries, not just a select few. The reason for this is that Google Forms doesn't come with a country dropdown built in. So in the early versions of the form I had 200~ so countries and it made the form hard to edit. So I decided to delete and merge some options that I thought wouldn't come up. I tried to avoid any controversial deletions where I could and make sure only countries that wouldn't get answers didn't. Other received 3 responses so I clearly failed at that. Two of those three came from South America while the third came from Asia. So in future, I should avoid removing options in censuses.

### <a name="Continents">Continents</a>

Question: *"What continent is that country on?"*

Continent data is interesting because it combines all of Europe together so that North America doesn't look as scary. It is good data to provide a NA vs Europe comparison since there are many European countries and only three large NA countries. I am only mentioning these two because these two then dwarf the other results (sorry Aussies and Kiwis ;-;). 


{{< figure src="../../img/census18-1/continentsbargraph.png" title="Groooovy 3D bar graph of the Continents data." alt="Groooovy 3D bar graph of the Continents data" >}}

As you can see at this point, Summer and I got bored and started to make the graphs are crazy as we could while still remaining informative. 

North America still by far towers over the other continents. Something that isn't quite as visible in the country data though is how large the amount of people from Europe is now that it isn't spread out.

Nothing really to report on in terms of improving the quality of results next time. 😊

## <a name="age">Age Range</a>

Question: *"How old are you?"*

Figuring out the age range of the userbase was a goal of mine due to what seemed to be a large number of young people, especially minors, in the server. Figuring out how best we can safeguard the minors and also to see what kind of culture we would be getting due to those age ranges. Memes are something that just inherently will attract this generation. And if you are saying "Roxie, you can't say 'this generation' because there is more than one!", then look at the data because it really is just one generation of users.

{{< figure src="../../img/census18-1/agerangesidewards.png" title="Summer really wanted this sidewards bar graph displaying the age range of the server. Mainly cause it looked cool. I had to convince them that making this 3D would just be too much for one person to handle." alt="Bar graph showing the ages of the server." >}}

We have a large number of young users, mostly between 18-23. The large number of under 18 users though shows that the staff do have a responsibility to safeguard this section of the community too. And to also make sure they don't get into the NSFW channels to protect the rest of the users. There is a super sharp decline past 29 and then just a cameo of older users from there. We got absolutely no one past the age of 42. 

Next time it would be interesting to use a shorter range of ages for the answers to get a more accurate portrayal of the bell curve. Though that does mean changing the ranges of the under 18 category because 5 was chosen because under 18 is actually 13-17 due to the rules of the server. So we would have to have two choices for underaged users to choose from which is a little bit of a challenge to keep the separation between underage and adult users in future data sets.

## <a name="identity">Identities</a>

The next two questions were about sexuality and gender identity of the userbase. The gender identity question is important to gauge the divide between the genders of GSSP, which has become increasingly required lately; and sexuality question being important for the same reasons albeit to a lesser extent. It’s also some interesting data because it helps us reflect on how the server is made up of many people with different identities and backgrounds. 

### <a name="gender">Gender Identity</a>

Question: *"How would you describe your gender?"*

{{< figure src="../../img/census18-1/genderpie.png" title="Pie chart showing the distribution of gender identity across the respondents. Enjoy its spectrum of flavours :3" alt="Pie chart of the distribution of gender identity across the respondents." >}}

As expected, trans women dominate the gender charts with 65%. I think this is down to our Reddit background. We are a subreddit's Discord server so I assume that the demographics there influence us here too. 

I was also surprised to see how large non-binary and questioning were and how dwarfed trans men are in the stats. Now while I have received a number of complaints about our non-binary options, it would be interesting to see how this shifts with further censuses over time. Maybe the questioning percentage will decrease and we might see an increase of other trans identities in this graph. 

This question did have some issues. Quite a few non-binary users complained about the options given as it was too restrictive on non-binary identities. This is something I will keep in mind for the next census and try and come up with a good middle ground to make the question more inclusive in future.

### <a name="sexuality">Sexuality</a>

Question: *"How would you describe your sexual orientation?"*

{{< figure src="../../img/census18-1/sexualdoughnut.png" title="Say hello... to the Sexuality Doughnut. We were really bored now." alt="piechart with a hole for sexualities across the gssp userbase" >}}

I find the number of people who identify as bi or pan to be very interesting. Seeing as we don't see that kind of break down in the normal population. Is it to do with the acceptance of bi and pan people in queer spaces naturally leading to more people being comfortable with the label and accepting that in themselves, or are trans people just more likely to be bi? Idk I just pretend to be smart. 

Also interesting how straight people are a minority in the userbase at only 7% which is beaten by people questioning their sexuality.

You are more likely to be a bi or gay woman than a hetero man in GSSP. Talk about the tables being flipped! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ As mentioned before though, we have really used these stats to help us mod better. Knowing which kinds of people are in the minority and making sure they can be comfortable in the space we provide is very important.

## <a name="questioning">Questioning</a>

Question: *"If you answered Cisgender or 'I am not sure' above, are you currently questioning your gender or have done so in the past?"*

We asked this optional question as to gauge how our cisgender and questioning users felt about their gender. This question isn't as graphable hence why I didn't make one. (We were also fed up with graphs at this point)

Unsurprisingly people who identified with questioning their gender said they were doing so. The part I really found interesting and is the reason I asked this is the cisgender responses. 

I really wanted to ask this question to confirm a hypothesis that most, if not all, cisgender people in GSSP were questioning or had questioned in the past in some way. People who tend to question their gender are more likely to be trans of course. This was a concern at the time the census was asked, for context. People were scared about chasers when it came to cispeople openly being cis and banning cis people was discussed in #server_discussion. 

All but one cisgender user said that they had or are questioning their gender in this question. 

With this in mind, I feel that my hypothesis has some weight. While it is like 3 months too late, I have some evidence for why I don't feel we should ban cis people from the GSSP Discord. That and we do our best to ban chasers as it is. 

A big issue of this question (that I had to account for the in the tables below) is unclarity. Many trans people answered the question. Either those people considered themselves still questioning or we need to be clearer that this is a optional question in the future.

## <a name="ferris">Ferris Final Question</a>

Question: *"If Ferris is happy/angry/sad, but no one is around to hear her, does she make a gay sound?"*

I really like joke questions. It's something /r/UKPolitics always do at the end of their surveys. At the end, there will always be a question about a duck. I don't mind making Ferris a similar mascot in that sense. I did a very similar question like this for the last moderator election too. So expect to see her more in the future! Even if we change name, I will make sure Ferris lives on as our mascot.

{{< figure src="../../img/census18-1/ferris.png" title="Nyaaaa~" alt="Nyaaaaaaa" >}}

Something that shocked me is how many people choose the random answer I put in there "OwO". Like it made no sense to me because it was randomly added for fun. Now I could just assume they choose it randomly too. But on reflection, I think there might be connotations of "OwO" and a girl all on her lonesome in the woods. I still don't know why it was so popular, but some of you might be perverts. Smh.


# <a name="conclusion">Conclusion</a>

In conclusion, statistics can be fun. This is something I, and a few others, want to make a more common thing. Maybe every six months? I think that it would be cool and we can use the data to keep improving the community. Something I am looking forward to next time, if we do one of these again, is the change we can observe between the demographics; especially when it comes to gender identity! 


## Improvements
We can definitely improve on a lot though. One thing I said at the beginning that I haven't mentioned yet is the lack of one question from section one. I omitted the language question because the data I got for that question was so bad I can't even quantify it in a meaningful or interesting way. Just a lot of people speak English. I think the only new thing I learned was the [Isle of Jersey has its own language? What?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A8rriais) I think that in the future, we should use a drop-down or nothing. 

While it was calculated that it was a pretty good turn out in retrospect, a larger percentage of the userbase wouldn't have hurt. This would have made our conclusions a lot stronger with a larger data set to back it up.

Other changes and issues with the section one questions have been talked about above. I haven't talked about section two and three's errors but that isn't too bad. Most the data we got from that was usable and we have applied it. Sorry again for not publishing it but it would take way too long to do an analysis of that data too. Also, it is a little embarrassing publishing the data that highlights your flaws from **3 months ago** >~<


## Thanks
Overall, I think this census was a big success and has helped us tremendously. I want to thank everyone who took part and helped us put this together. Your help is invaluable and you are all fantastic members of our community. Hopefully, we can keep building and make GSSP a great community and server to be in. 💙
